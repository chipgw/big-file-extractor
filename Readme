This is a basic extractor for SAGE engine (the Battle for Middle Earth and Command & Conquer series) .BIG files that I made a couple years back.
It was written in C# using Visual Studio 2010.

This is just some old code I thought I would upload in case someone had a use for it, I honestly don't give a darn what you do with it.

Note: this functionality is included in OpenBFME project, at github.com/chipgw/openbfme
